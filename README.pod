=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module filters POD to generate a F<README> file, by using POD
commands to specify which parts are included or excluded from the
F<README> file.

See the L<Pod::Readme> documentation for more details on the POD
syntax that this module recognizes.

See L<pod2readme> for command-line usage.
